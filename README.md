Hello, my name is Luca D'Ambrosio. I am twenty-one years old and was born in Pescara (Pe), Abruzzo, Italy, on 07/25/2001. I obtained my high school diploma from the "Galileo Galilei Scientific High School." During my high school years, I participated in two "Computer Science" championships, achieving second place in one of them. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for IT and realized that programming was my future and greatest passion.
</br>
After graduating, I enrolled at the University of L'Aquila to study "Information Engineering" with a specialization in "DATABASE." However, after about a year, I had the opportunity to work at a company called "Rapsodoo" in Rome, where I currently serve as a "Backend Developer." My experience includes programming in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and using tools such as GitHub, Docker, and Java. In my spare time, I am also studying other languages like TypeScript and Angular to broaden my knowledge and skills, especially in frontend development.

Due to the limitations of in-person education at my university, I made the decision to switch to online learning and joined the "ECampus University" to pursue my studies in Computer Engineering with a focus on "DATABASE."
